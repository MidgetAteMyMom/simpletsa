# SimpleTSA

A very small and simple TSA [(Timestamping Authority)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_timestamping), I needed it for my development environment, so I built it.

It just signs a timestamp and whatever it receives with the configured certificate. It's for development only, not full valid response.
