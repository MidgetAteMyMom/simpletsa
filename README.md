# SimpleTSA

A very small and simple TSA [(Timestamping Authority)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_timestamping), I needed it for my development environment, so I built it.

It just signs a timestamp and whatever it receives with the configured certificate. It's for development only, not full valid response.

# How to create a TSA certificate

Refer to this file for that: https://github.com/pcarranza/simpletsa/blob/master/cert/how_to_create_timestamping_cert.md
